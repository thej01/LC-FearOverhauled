# Fear Overhauled
Fear Overhauled is a client-sided mod that gives that screen and audio effect a purpose on your gameplay.

When you are under the fear status, you will be able to run slighty faster, have a bigger sprint gauge, and depending on the **Fear State** be immune to limping.



But being scared isnt a good thing for you, you stamina regen will be **significantly** worse until you calm down.

So depending on the situation, being scared can be good for you, but it could also be your __demise__.

# Fear Stages
There are several stages to fear, the stat effects of fear get worse and worse depending on the severity.

Here they are in terms of calmest to least-calmest



1. Stressed (Activated at 1% fear)
2. Scared (Activated at 25% fear)
3. Horrified (Activated at 50% fear)
4. Panic Attack (Activated at 85% fear)

Horrified and Panic Attack stages have a special property that will make you immune to limping.

# I dont really like \*insert mechanic\*
This mod comes with a config, so you can edit every mechanic there.

...except for the worse stamina regen, that will always be enabled.

That is not there because I don't want this mod to be abused in public lobbies.

Otherwise you can change everything else!

# Hey, can I use Fear Overhauled in (blank)?
**Yes!**

You can do whatever you want with this mod! (as long as it's not paid for)

Include it in modpacks, include it in your mods, just do it!

Just give me credit with a link back to the original mod page, that's all I ask for.

# How can I help with Fear Overhauled?
I am in need of localizers, currently the mod only supports these languages

* English

If you know how to translate English into a language that isn't on here, please contact me on discord at __"thej_01"__

There's only 2 dialogue strings in the mod, but it still would be nice for them to be translated.
