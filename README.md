# Fear Overhauled
Fear Overhauled is a client-sided mod that gives that screen and audio effect a purpose on your gameplay.

When you are under the fear status, you will be able to run slighty faster, have a bigger sprint gauge, and depending on the **Fear State** be immune to limping.



But being scared isnt a good thing for you, you stamina regen will be **significantly** worse until you calm down.

So depending on the situation, being scared can be good for you, but it could also be your __demise__.

# Fear Stages
There are several stages to fear, the stat effects of fear get worse and worse depending on the severity.

Here they are in terms of calmest to least-calmest



1. Stressed (Activated at 1% fear)
2. Scared (Activated at 25% fear)
3. Horrified (Activated at 50% fear)
4. Panic Attack (Activated at 85% fear)

Horrified and Panic Attack stages have a special property that will make you immune to limping.

# I dont really like \*insert mechanic\*
This mod comes with a config, so you can edit every mechanic there.

...except for the worse stamina regen, that will always be enabled.

That is not there because I don't want this mod to be abused in public lobbies.

Otherwise you can change everything else!

# How can I help with Fear Overhauled?
I am in need of localizers, currently the mod only supports these languages

* English
* German
* Russian

If you know how to translate English into a language that isn't on here, please contact me on discord at __"thej_01"__

There's only 2 dialogue strings in the mod, but it still would be nice for them to be translated.
